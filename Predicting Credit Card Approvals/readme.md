# Predicting Credit Card Approvals

I used the Credit Approval Dataset which is a collection of credit card applications and the credit approval decisions. The data is available from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/credit+approval). <br>
I built a predictive model using lostic regression.
