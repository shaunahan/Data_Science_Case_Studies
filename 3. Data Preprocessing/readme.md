# 1. JSON File Preprocessing

Used the __String Similarity Ratio__ to Clean Text Data
In this challenge, I pre-processed a JSON text file. The file contained uncleaned data for shape, color, and area.
To efficiently clean and unify the values of columns, I used  the `string similarity ratio` to automate the preprocessing step, instead of mannually changing values to be aligned with the unique values of each column.
