# Wine Quality Prediction 

For this project, I used UCI’s Red Wine Quality dataset to build various classification models to predict whether a particular red wine is “good quality” or not. <br> 
Dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality <br>
Each wine in this dataset is given a “quality” score between 3 and 8. For the purpose of this project, I converted the output to a binary output where each wine is either “good quality” (a score of 6, 7, 8) or not (3,4,5). <br>
<br>
There are 1599 instances in the dataset and with 12 columns. The final column is the ‘Quality’ which is used as target variable. <br>
The quality of a wine is determined by 11 input variables:
<br><br>
Fixed acidity
Volatile acidity
Citric acid
Residual sugar
Chlorides
Free sulfur dioxide
Total sulfur dioxide
Density
pH
Sulfates
Alcohol
