# Project_Portfolio

This repository contains projects and cases studies I have worked on over time using Python, R, and SQL 
on topics such as machine learning, NLP, data preprocessing/transformation, and statistics.

## Projects 
* __Machine Learning__ <br>
    * `Home Price Prediction`: Use linear regression to predict the price of homes in Bangalore city. Pre-processed the data with outlier utlier detection and removal, feature engineering, and dimensionality reduction. <br><br>
    * `Wine Quality Prediction`: Compared eight different machine learning models (Random Forest Classifier, Multi Layer Perceptron, Gradient Boosting Classifier, Decision Tree, SVM, Logistic Regression, K Nearest Neighbors, and Gaussian NB.) to predict whether a particular red wine is good quality or not.Random Forest Classifier yielded the best performance in classifying the quality of the read wine with 81% accuracy.  <br><br>
    * `Age Prediction Model`: Use three different datasets of the linkedin profile data to predict ages of the users. Preprocessed and merged datasets to select important features, predicted age using linear regression.
   * `Flower Image Prediction`: Flowers Classification using the VGG16 architecture. Used 2936 images of flowers (daisy, dandelion, roses, sunflowers, tulips), and obtained the classification performance of 80% accuracy. <br><br>
    * `Potato Disease Classification`: Built a CNN deep learning model is to classify potato plant images as healthy, early blight or late blight. <br><br>
    *  `Sports Celebrities Image Classification` : Used the Harr cascade to detect face and eyes in photos, and used wavelet transformation to compress the images for model training. Trained on different models (SVM, Random Forest, Logistic Regression) and assessed the score. <br>
    *  `Machine Learning HW` : a sample HW 
    
* __NLP__ <br>
   * `Topic Modeling` : preprocessed the raw text data (ie. removing stop words, lemmatization, tokenization, etc) and applied topic modellings to find the most prevalent themes in the text. <br>
   * `Text Analysis`: Knowledge Graph, Word Clouds, Text models (logistic models with vectorizers (Count Vectorizer, TF-IDF Vectorizer, nltk), and author classification model using logistic regression.

* __Data Preprocessing__ <br>
    * classified keywords (shapes) in the dataset using the _similarity ratio_ <br>
    * NYC 311 Public Data Preprocessing 
    
* __Applied Finance__ <br>
   * `Predicting Credit Card Approvals`: preprocess the dataset and fit a logistic regression model to the train set, make predictions and evaluate performance. <br>
   * `The Sharpe Ratio`: comparing the profitability and risk of Amazon and Facebook investments using the Sharpe Ratio. <br>
* __Exercises in R__ <br>
   * `Gender Bias in Graduate Admission` <br>
