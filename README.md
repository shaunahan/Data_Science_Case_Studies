# Project_Portfolio

This repository contains projects and cases studies I have worked on over time using Python, R, and SQL 
on topics such as machine learning, NLP, data preprocessing/transformation, and statistics.

## Projects 
* Machine Learning <br>
    * __Home Price Prediction__: Use linear regression to predict the price of homes in Bangalore city. Pre-processed the data with outlier utlier detection and removal, feature engineering, and dimensionality reduction. <br>
    * __Flower Image Prediction__: Flowers Classification using the VGG16 architecture. Used 2936 images of flowers (daisy, dandelion, roses, sunflowers, tulips), and obtained the classification performance of 80% accuracy. <br>
    * __Wine Quality Prediction__: Compared eight different machine learning models (Random Forest Classifier, Multi Layer Perceptron, Gradient Boosting Classifier, Decision Tree, SVM, Logistic Regression, K Nearest Neighbors, and Gaussian NB.) to predict whether a particular red wine is good quality or not.Random Forest Classifier yielded the best performance in classifying the quality of the read wine with 81% accuracy.  <br>
    * __Potato Disease Classification__: Built a CNN deep learning model is to classify potato plant images as healthy, early blight or late blight.
 <br>
    *  __Sports Celebrities Image Classification__: Used the Harr cascade to detec face and eyes in photos, and used wavelet transformation to compress the images for model training. Trained on different models (SVM, Random Forest, Logistic Regression) and assessed the score. <br>
    *  __Machine Learning HW__ : a sample HW 

* NLP <br>
   * __Topic Modeling__ : preprocessed the raw text data (ie. removing stop words, lemmatization, tokenization, etc) and applied topic modellings to find the most prevalent themes in the text. <br>
   * __Text Analysis__: Knowledge Graph, Word Clouds, Text models (logistic models with vectorizers (Count Vectorizer, TF-IDF Vectorizer, nltk), and author classification model using logistic regression.

* Data Preprocessing <br>
    * classified keywords (shapes) in the dataset using the similarity ratio <br>
    * NYC 311 Public Data Preprocessing 
    
* Applied Finance <br>
   * __Predicting Credit Card Approvals__: preprocess the dataset and fit a logistic regression model to the train set, make predictions and evaluate performance. <br>
   * __The Sharpe Ratio__: comparing the profitability and risk of Amazon and Facebook investments using the Sharpe Ratio. <br>
* Exercises - R <br>
   * Gender Bias in Graduate Admission <br>
