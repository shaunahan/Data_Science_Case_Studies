# Using the String Similarity Ratio to clean text data
In this challenge, I pre-processed a JSON text file. The file contained uncleaned data for shape, color, and area.
To efficiently clean and unify the values of columns, I used  the <b> string similarity ratio </b> to automate the preprocessing step, instead of mannually changing values to be aligned with the unique values of each column.
