# Home_Prices_Prediction

The aim of the project is to predict the price of home in Bangalore city on the basis of past data using a linear regression model. <br><br>
During model building, I used the concepts such as data load and cleaning, outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, gridsearchcv for hyperparameter tunning, and k fold cross validation etc.
