# Sports_Celebrities_Image_Classification

In this data science and machine learning project, we classified sports personalities. Classification was restricted to 5 people: <br>
1) Maria Sharapova
2) Serena Williams
3) Virat Kohli
4) Roger Federer
5) Lionel Messi

## Steps:
* Use the Harr cascade to detect face and eyes
* Write a python function to crop and filter images with faces with only two eyes. (discard face images that have a side view)
* Use wavelet transform as a feature. Use the prepared (cropped) images with wavelet transformed images to train our model.
* Train different models (SVM, Random Forest, Logistic Regression) and assess the scores.
* Fine-tune parameters of the best performing model, and assess the model again using the test set.



## Technologies used in this project:
1. Python (jupyter notebook)
2. Numpy and OpenCV for data cleaning
3. Matplotlib & Seaborn for data visualization
4. Sklearn for model building
